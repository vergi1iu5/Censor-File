once upon a time there was a monkey. This monkey had no friends and so all
he did all day was play his piano, learn python, and play video games. He did
have a few friends but they all worked all day. One of them had a boyfriend and so
many of the days during the week, the friend would hang out with the boyfriend and
completly ignore the monkey. One day, the monkey got tired and he burned down the entire
house. The end.
